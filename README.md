# CofWah

* in this crisis India had impacted badly and among many problems one problem is that many people espescially from rural background they do not have proper knowledge and due to lack of english reading proficiency and many tv journalists + official sites of healthcare do not printing the myths and rumors in a collected format in hindi language that's why many people blindly following the myths and it also affected quite a lot, people have to put their own time and struggle to know the validity of myth on internet.
* So we had collected all the myths and had put in the hindi language format in this SPA (single page application) with user friendly format also we had 
* we had indexed this application on google and with light SEO modifications and it had responded well !!
* you can also provide us any myth that has been circulating in your locality we will try to find its validity and will render it in the application afterwards.
* we had included  vaccine finder in the application we are working in its design part and will update asap (sorry for the unexpected delays due to unpredicted problems )









# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
